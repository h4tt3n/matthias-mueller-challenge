# matthias-mueller-challenge
Open repo containing submissions for the Mattias Müller PBD challenge

# Description
This repo contains papers and code samples that describe and demonstrate two techniques: 

 - A very simple but powerful re-interpretation of Hooke's spring equation.
 - A very simple impulse based iterative solver.

In combination they outperform PBD with less calculations.

The techniques also challenge some old "universal truths" in the world of game physics,
most noticeable the idea that in order to get infinite spring stiffness you need an infinitely
big stiffness coefficient value. As we will see, this is not true, by far.
